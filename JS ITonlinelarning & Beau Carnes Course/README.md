JavaScript – Learning Notebook

This folder contains my JavaScript practice files, written by me while learning from online tutorials and courses.

The main goal of this repository is to:

practice coding

understand concepts deeply

quickly refresh when I forget something

build a personal “external brain” for programming

All code is written manually and includes comments in Romanian so I can easily understand it again later.

What you’ll find here

Each file represents a small lesson or exercise:

findLengthOfString.js – finding the length of a string

stringConcatenation.js – joining strings

bracketNotation.js – accessing characters in a string

strictInequality.js – the difference between != and !==

(More files will be added as I continue learning.)

How I use this folder

When I learn something new → I create a file.

I write the code with explanations in Romanian.

When I forget → I search this repository and review.

I improve the code as my understanding grows.
